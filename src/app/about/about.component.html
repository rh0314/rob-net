            <p>Hi!</p>

            <p>My name is Rob Harrison and I am an Application Developer with extensive experience developing
              multi-tiered, database-driven applications. I have over ten years of experience developing highly
              customized applications used to run various business systems and processes within Intel Corporation.
              In
              this role, I assisted with requirements gathering and built applications from concept to deployment,
              and
              then supported many of them throughout their lifespans. I left Intel in 2016 and went on to work for a
              regional financial institution developing and maintaining custom online banking software. After that I
              spent some time back at Intel on a six-month contract to develop an application for use by their
              Information Security group.</p>


            <p>Currently I’d say my strongest passion for development lies with the various
              JavaScript/HTML5-based
              frameworks that have come out in the last five-or-so years, particularly Angular (all versions) and,
              to a
              lesser degree, ReactJS. Client-side programming has always been so much fun to me because of its
              speedy
              responsiveness to user interaction. <img align="right" src="../../assets/images/valley-girl-postback.gif"
                class="valley-girl-image" /> But, historically, it has been quite labor-intensive. (Basically,
              you
              could do anything, but you had to write a lot of code to accomplish it!) But with frameworks like
              these,
              much of the “under the hood” work is done already, developers are able to devote much more time to
              building a slick, user-friendly applications without tons of overhead. (And when I mention overhead,
              I’m
              looking at you, Silverlight!) Of course, before those frameworks came along, I developed nearly
              everything
              in ASP.NET using C# and Visual Basic. Even still I use ASP.NET/C# for most of my data layers and
              business
              logic layers.

              <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>I love learning new technologies, especially ones that enable me to create super cool apps! But I
                  don’t
                  adopt and use a new technology for a project just because “everyone’s going to it.” I’m all about
                  using
                  the right tool for the job -- whatever is going to give the customer the features they want and need
                  in
                  the time allotted for development. My feelings here also stem from having inherited too many apps from
                  developers who went crazy with some abstract new framework or methodology, just to do it, which made
                  for
                  supportability and maintainability nightmares! On top of that, I’ve watched a few too many development
                  teams who walked the bleeding edge simply because that’s what their friends were doing, only to
                  discover
                  half way through a project that they had bitten off way more than they could chew and over-engineered
                  themselves into a mess. (But, hey, at least you can say you were one of the to use it,
                  right? Oh, and one of the last, too.)</p>
              </div>

            <p>Through all of these years writing code, I’ve worked closely with User Experience (UX) engineers and
              I’ve
              learned a lot from them. When I’m designing my application or writing my code, it’s always with my
              mind on
              creating an intuitive, informative interface that will make my users’ lives easier while they’re doing
              their job using the tool I’ve built. After all, people have to use these tools every day, sometimes
              for
              the majority of their day and the tools I build to for them should not just facilitate their work
              processes, but should also enhance them.
            </p>

            <p>And that (creating applications that blow away users’ expectations) is the second of at least two ways
              I
              derive pleasure from what I do. The first, as I used to think of it when I was a kid and teaching myself
              various coding languages, is the fun I get from “making the computer do whatever I want.” You know, the
              nerdy pleasure that comes from thinking of something you want or need a program to do, and making it
              happen. When I was a kid and my parents would make a joke like, <img align="left"
                src="../../assets/images/thumbsup-mitchell.v3.png" class="thumbs-up-image" /> “What’s next? Is it
              going to make my
              breakfast
              toast, too?” My immediate thought would be along the lines of “I’m sure there’s a way to make that
              happen,
              want me to do it?!” Since then, since I began writing code for a living rather than just for my own
              amusement, I’ve discovered all the ways in which it makes people’s lives easier and more productive. So
              I
              guess that’s cool, too!</p>
