            <p>Hi!</p>

            <p>My name is Rob Harrison and I am an Application Developer with extensive experience developing
              multi-tiered, database-driven applications. I have over ten years of experience developing highly
              customized applications used to run various business systems and processes within Intel Corporation. In
              this role, I assisted with requirements gathering and built applications from concept to deployment,
              and then supported many of them throughout their lifespans. I left Intel in 2016 and went on to work
              for a regional financial institution developing and maintaining custom online banking software. After
              that I spent some time back at Intel on a six-month contract to develop an application for use by their
              Information Security group.</p>

            <p>Currently I’d say my strongest passion for development lies with the various JavaScript/HTML5-based
              frameworks that have come out in the last five-or-so years, particularly Angular (all versions) and
              ReactJS. And my strong preference between the two of those at the moment is for Angular, but really
              they’re both awesome in the way that they allow such flexibility for a developer to come up with slick,
              user-friendly applications without tons of overhead. (And when I mention overhead, I’m looking at you,
              Silverlight!) Of course, before those frameworks came along, I developed nearly everything in ASP.NET
              using C# and Visual Basic. Even still I use ASP.NET/C# for most of my data layers and business logic
              layers.</p>

            <p>I love moving forward with the new technologies, but I don’t adopt and use a new technology for a
              project just because “everyone’s going to it.” I’m all about using the right tool for the job; whatever
              is going to give the customer the features they want and need, is going to be sustainable and
              supportable into the future. I’ve seen too many development teams that lived on the bleeding edge of
              technology simply because that’s what their friends were doing, and then discovered half way through a
              project that they didn’t know what they were getting themselves into and/or they over-engineered
              themselves into a real predicament.</p>

            <p>Through all of these years writing code, I’ve also worked closely with User Experience (UX) engineers
              and I’ve learned a lot from them. When I’m designing my application or writing my code, it’s always
              with my mind on creating an intuitive, informative interface that will make my users’ lives easier
              while they’re doing their job using the tool I’ve built. After all, people have to use these tools
              every day, sometimes for the majority of their day and the tools I build to for them should not just
              facilitate their work processes, but should also enhance them.</p>
