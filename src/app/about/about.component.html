              <p>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. There is no right or wrong - as long as it
                makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Everyone
                is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. And I will hypnotize that just
                a
                little bit.</p>

              <p>Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This
                should make you happy. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. See. We take the corner of the brush
                and let it play back-and-forth. The least little bit can do so much.</p>

              <p>I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just make little strokes like that. All
                kinds
                of happy little splashes. Just use the old one inch brush. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Even
                the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>

              <p>Let's build some happy little clouds up here. By now you should be quite happy about what's
                happening
                here. See there how easy that is. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See
                it
                finished in your mind before you ever start.</p>

              <p>Very easy to work these to death. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You
                have
                that power. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take
                care
                of
                them. That's crazy. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>
